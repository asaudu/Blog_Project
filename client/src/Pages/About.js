		My first time traveling was at the tender age of 2. Left my homeland and ventured over to the US. As one may imagine, I don't quite remember that trip. BUT, I do however remember the first time I went back to Nigeria. That ignited my desire for traveling overseas, and that flame has stayed strong since.
